<h1><center>Reflection & Evaluation</center></h1>
	<h2>Evaluation</h2>
	<p>After studying this course for six weeks, I learned more about programming and coding. I feel myself improving, as I can understand the linking between different python files; what are the programs doing(some) now, in which I had zero confidence in programming before. I cannot say my faith in programming increased significantly, but I am a different person than myself in week one. </p>
<h2>Reflection on action</h2>
<p>I think the most enjoyable thing is to type in codes and see them working. But it is very frustrating to see them not working after I typed or changed some codings, espectially when they worked previously.  I do not like the feeling of failure, that is cannot run the program I made, which makes me feel reluctant to be in touched with programming. </p>
<p>Also, I often forget what I learned in lessons and self-learning. I am also poor at problem-solving. When I cannot run a program, it takes a long time for me to find out what is wrong, and I often cannot find out. I can only ask the teacher for help. Therefore, sometimes I feel reluctant to solve the bug or error myself, as I would probably fail again. Also, since I did not learn Python before, it is hard for me to catch up during lessons, in which I need to watch the lesson recordings every week. I need to work harder at remembering technical terms and their usage, as they are commonly used in programming.  </p>
	
	<p>I feel frustrated with my current self, as my progress is plodding. However, I believe I improved a lot compared to myself in week one, from knowing nothing about Python to understanding more and more after weeks, such as the linkage between other python modules, class, public and private attributes.  </p>
	
<h2>Reflection for action</h2>
	<p>I revised computing from week one to seven by watching the lecture and lab recordings. Although they helped me better understand what I learned, there are some technical terms that I still cannot remember. When I watched the recordings, even though I understood what I was doing, there were still some codes that I did not understand. To cope with this, I should make a keyword list on the technical terms of Python.   </p>
